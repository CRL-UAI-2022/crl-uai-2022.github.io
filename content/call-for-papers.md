# Call for Papers

We welcome submissions related to any aspects of CRL, including but not limited to:

* Learning latent (structural) causal models & structured (deep) generative models
* Interventional representations, causal digital twins & structured (causal) world models
* Post-hoc extraction of causal relations from (deep) generative models
* Self-supervised causal representation learning
* Multi-environment & multi-view causal representation learning
* Micro vs. macro/coarse-grained/multi-level causal systems
* Identifiable representation learning & nonlinear ICA
* Uncertainty quantification in (causal) representation learning
* Group-theoretic & symmetry-based views on disentanglement
* Invariance & equivariance in representation learning
* Interdisciplinary perspectives on causal representation learning, including from cognitive science, psychology, (computational) neuroscience or philosophy
* Real-world applications of causal representation learning, including in biology, medical sciences, or robotics


Submissions should present novel, unpublished work. Work that previously appeared in non-archival venues (such as arXiv or other workshops without proceedings) is allowed.

The CRL workshop is non-archival, and should thus generally not violate dual submission policies at other archival venues (e.g., submitting work that is currently under review at another conference such as NeurIPS is permitted); if unsure, please check yourself with the corresponding venue.

## Important Dates

* **Paper submission deadline:** **June 6, 2022, 23:59 AoE**
* **Notification to authors:** July 5, 2022, 23:59 AoE
* **Camera-ready version:** August 12, 2022, 23:59 AoE
* **Workshop Date:** August 5, 2022


## Style & Author Instructions

Submissions should be formatted using the [UAI latex template and formatting instructions](https://www.auai.org/uai2022/formatting/uai2022-template.zip). Papers must be submitted as a PDF file and should be 4-6 pages in length, including all main results, figures, and tables. Appendices containing additional details are allowed, but reviewers are not expected to take this into account.

## Camera-Ready Revisions 

Camera-Ready revisions are now enabled in OpenReview. While the workshop has no official proceedings, we strongly encourage you to submit a revised "camera-ready" version taking reviewers' comments and suggestions into account. We suggest uploading a revised version prior to the workshop, and possibly another final version (incorporating additional feedback from the poster session and workshop) by the revision deadline of 12 August, one week after the workshop. 


## Updated Style-File 

To prepare your revision/camera-ready version, please use the following template: https://www.overleaf.com/read/jcgtpdmnkfhy [Menu -> Download Source -> unzip -> replace previous style file with the new uaicrl2022.cls -> add \documentclass[accepted]{uaicrl2022} to your tex file]

## Orals 

For those papers selected for oral presentation, congratulations! Please prepare a 15min talk (incl. questions, e.g., 12min talk + 3min questions) in addition to your poster. By default, we'll assume that the first author will speak; should this not be the case, or should you not be able to present in person, please reach out to us.
