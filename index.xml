A key strength of ML over earlier (symbolic, logic and rule-based) approaches to AI, is its ability to infer useful features or representations of often very high-dimensional observations in an automated, data-driven way. However, in doing so, it generally only leverages statistical information (e.g., correlations present in a training set) and consequently struggles at tasks such as knowledge transfer, systematic generalization, or planning, which are thought to require higher-order cognition.</description></item><item><title>Accepted Papers</title><link>/accepted-papers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/accepted-papers/</guid><description>Accepted Papers To be announced.</description></item><item><title>Call for Papers</title><link>/call-for-papers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/call-for-papers/</guid><description>Call for Papers We welcome submissions related to any aspects of CRL, including but not limited to:

His research interests lie at the intersection of causal inference and machine learning, including causal reasoning for explainability, recourse and fairness; causal discovery; and identifiable causal representation learning. He has interned at Amazon (2019 - 2021) and was awarded a Google PhD Fellowship in Machine Learning in 2022.</description></item><item><title>Schedule</title><link>/schedule/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/schedule/</guid><description>Schedule (Times are according to Central European Summer Time)
